# Jenkins Extension Pack

This extension pack includes some of the most popular (and some of my favorite) extensions for developing Jenkins jobs and shared libraries.

## Extensions Included

* [Groovy-Guru](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DontShaveTheYak.groovy-guru) - Groovy Intellisense for Visual Studio Code.
* [VsCode Groovy Lint, Format and Fix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NicolasVuillamy.vscode-groovy-lint) - Lint, format and auto-fix groovy and Jenkinsfile.
* [Jenkins Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Maarti.jenkins-doc) - Provides Jenkins documentation and autocompletion on Jenkinsfile and Groovy files.
